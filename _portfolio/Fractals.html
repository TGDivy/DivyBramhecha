<p>This project won the 2nd competition at University of Edinburgh Haskell competition 2018.
</p>

<p>
    Various fractals are developed and combined, creating in a beautiful scenery.
</p>

<p>
    This demonstrates the power of fractals.
</p>

<p>
    Moreover, this can have many applications, specially for game developers looking to develop quick proceduraly
    generated background artwork.
