Iâ€™m a senior at University of Edinburgh student majoring in Artificial Intelligence. 

I'm passionate about understanding the human brain, and what I truly am. By trying create Intelligent agents I hope to understand myself better.

Currently, I am obsessed over our ways of communication.
Natural Language is complex, and a very evident difference between us and animals. I believe modelling natural language and creating agents which can understand it well will certainly lead me a step closer to understanding human intelligence.

I am also exploring the intersection of Natural Language Processing, Vision, and Reinforcement Learning.

##### New opportunities

I specialize in Natural Language Processing (be it "traditional" or neural) and I enjoy bringing theory into production. I'm fluent in Python and work in an agile, user-centered space.

In days past, I worked as a research intern in Dialog Systems and Machine Learning lab in HHU. Here, I developed novel algorithms to support frictionless task-oriented conversations.

Following that, I aslo worked at Adarga, doing cool things with language models and developing our explainable AI strategy, and the Entity Disambiguation pipeline.

Currently, I am looking for new opportunities where I can continue developing my skills as developer while helping solve important problems.

##### Projects

I love problem solving in general and often during my free time, I will develop a project that helps me learn a new skill. 

Please feel free to check out some of my projects recent projects [here](/portfolio)

##### My inspiration for AI

Being part of the mensa society, allowed me attend various camps which helped me enhance my observation and meditation skills.

These long meditation hours often left me to question life, and our purpose in it.

Following that, I attended a summer study programme on neuroscience by Duke University.

All such experiences have led me to pursue understanding myself, and our brain.

Therfore, my deep interests in Philosophy, Psychology and Engineering drive me to answer these big questions of life.

***I feel that if one day we do create an object with thoughts at least as deep and complex as us we could find a lot about our own purpose in life.***

Until then, I shall spend my time creating such an intelligence.
