About Me
======
My Inspiration in AI stems from my deep interests in Philosophy, Psychology and Engineering. I feel that if one day we do create an object with thoughts at least as real as us we could find a lot about our purpose of life. Currently I am a student and exploring all methods of developing AI, from Deep Neural Networks to Genetic models. 

I am writing a tutorial blog series, which covers all my research and explains it to people interested in learning Natural Language Processing!
