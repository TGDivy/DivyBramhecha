About Me
======

My Inspiration in AI stems from my deep interests in Philosophy,
Psychology and Engineering. I feel that if one day we do create an
object with thoughts at least as real as us we could find a lot about
our purpose of life. Until then, my purpose is to try to create such an
intelligence. Currently, I am a undergrad and want to explore all
subtopics of AI like: Natural Language Processing, Vision, and
Reinforcement Learning.
