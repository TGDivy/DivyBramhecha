An introduction to concepts of programming, using a functional programming language, and to concepts of computation and specification using finite-state systems and propositional logic. These provide examples of the logical ideas of syntax and semantics and the computational ideas of structure and behaviour. Students learn to specify, model and solve small-scale problems succinctly and at an abstract level.

This course focuses on approaches relating to representation, reasoning and planning for solving real world inference. The course illustrates the importance of:
- Using a smart representation of knowledge such that it is conducive to efficient reasoning
- The need for exploiting task constraints for intelligent search and planning. 

The notion of representing action, space and time is formalized in the context of agents capable of sensing the environment and taking actions that affect the current state. There is also a strong emphasis on the ability to deal with uncertain data in real world scenarios and hence, the planning and reasoning methods are extended to include inference in probabilistic domains.
